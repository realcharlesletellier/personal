I'll be honest, I haven't done much yet... in fact, I haven't really done anything. So much for starting a company. I scrambled around a bit to secure a source of income over the summer... made an impulse decision to get cats, and now, I'm making a vow to make a project a week. Crazy times. This website is kind of slowly becoming my journal... not sure if anyone will see this, but if they do, well, whatever.

As spring comes to an end, and the summer begins, the heat slowly trickling in and my fears of having 'not gotten enough done' settles, I start to wonder. . . what do I want to do?

I mean, I know I want to be succesful. I want to have fun. I want to make money and live comfortably- but is working in industry for 20 years than retiring really the only way to do that? Is that the fate which I've consigned myself to? I thought that's what I WANTED, to be paid a high salary and to have good work life balance. But I've never had good work life balance, and it was actually in those periods of my life which I was happiest. Wow. What a realization.

I'm starting to think I thrive more off being placed into stressful situations. Now, more than ever, I want to start figuring out what I ACTUALLY want in life.

What do I want?
