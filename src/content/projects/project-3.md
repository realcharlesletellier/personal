NearMe displays upcoming events in the Kingston Area, scraping Eventbrite to fetch links and details, filtering the results according to my own tastes and interests. It's my own little tool for keeping up with what's going on near me. Hopefully, it can help me be a bit more entrepreneurial and social.
